# UBC Flow

## Description

A generative AI-powered academic advising service.

**Motivation**

The problem our team decided to tackle using UBC Flow was streamlining the creation of timetables geared towards each student's career interests. While the SSC has all the available resources needed, it can be difficult to navigate the interface to bypass pre-requisites, course descriptions, professors and more. With our new technology, users can now create their ideal timetable with the click of a button, providing what interests they may have and what they hope to pursue in the future. They can specify course content and times to suit their individual needs best. On top of that, it serves as a system to plan your present course choices to ensure you complete your degree suited to your learning.

We utilized a basic web scraper

## Installation

To run our project, clone into your repository, then install all packages in the requirements.txt file. The website can be visualized at http://localhost:8501/. 

## Usage

For usage, students can ask course questions related to the computer science field (ie CPSC, DSCI, MATH, STATS, etc). Our web scraping stores course names, sections, timings and professors, allowing our generative AI to adapt and respond, providing students with the most accurate answer to their queries.
