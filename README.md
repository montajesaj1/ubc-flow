# UBC Flow

## Description

A generative AI powered academic advising service.

The problem our team decided to tackle using UBC Flow was streamlining the creation of timetables geared towards each individual students career interests. While the SSC has all the available resources needed, it can be difficult to navigating the interface to bypass pre-requistes, course descriptions, professors and more. With our new technology, users can now create their ideal timetable with the click of button, providing what interests they may have and what they hope to pursue in the future. They can specify course content and times to best suit their individual needs. On top of that, it serves as a system to plan your present courses choices to ensure you complete your degree suited to your learning.

We utilized a basic web scraper

## Installation

To run our project, clone into your repository, then run npm install and npm run dev. The website can be visualized at http://localhost:3000/. We currently host at the domain studyscout.tech. 

## Usage

For usage, our device tracks user motion to determine if a desk is occupied or not. The data is stored in our database (MongoDB) which is updated in real-time to our webpage. Users can then see which spaces are open and plan accordingly for their study times. You can link with your own databases in MongoDB if needed.
